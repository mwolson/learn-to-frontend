* Read Lesson 1.
* Read Lesson 2 and follow the instructions create a GitHub account and set up your website.
* Think about what kind of content you want on your website. Some example content: pictures, education, work experience, countries you have visited, hobbies and activities. Make a folder on your computer and add the content to that folder, so that it's easy to use in the lessons. Example website: http://ivesvh.com/ .
* If you have time, try some of the code in Lesson 1 to see what kind of changes you can make.
* If you don't have a computer, try to import the react-dates project from GitHub into CodeSandbox. Or just create a new React project and try out some of the `React components` in Lesson 1.
